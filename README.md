This app allows user to add pins on a map. When adding new place, there is list of nearby places from wiki API, so you can tap on it and the name and description fields will be filled with this information. You can edit pins, or see them in a list. The current application is still in the development stage. More color schemes will be added later. If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me.
